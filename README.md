# chalet-example-scripts

This repository showcases how to utilize various script targets in a [Chalet](https://www.chalet-work.space) project.

To get started, [download Chalet](https://www.chalet-work.space/download), check out some of the documentation for it, and either build with the various commands from the command line, or try out the [Chalet VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chalet-org.vscode-chalet) (recommended).


Note:
- for interpreters on Windows that aren't found (ruby for instance), msys2 is generally the easiest way to get them
- For python, Chalet does handle python 2/3 executable differences, but "python" (3) is the most preferred now. On mac, you may want to make a symlink to python3 called "python" (and use the version from Homebrew)
